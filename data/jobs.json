In 8 peer-reviewed publications, DynamiCare increased quit rates for opioids, stimulants, alcohol, and tobacco by 2-4x compared to typical treatment. DynamiCare has won FDA Breakthrough Status and is already breaking into U.S. healthcare system reimbursement with partners that include the State of Rhode Island, Allegheny County of Pennsylvania, BCBS of Massachusetts, Horizon BCBSNJ, Spring Health, and Cityblock Health. \nWe understand that recovery isn't one-size-fits-all, which is why our platform provides the flexibility and continuous support needed for sustainable behavior change.
