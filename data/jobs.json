    "description": "Headquarters: Raleigh, NC, USA\n    \nURL: https://www.nutrient.io\n\n\nWho We Are…\nAt Nutrient, we equip developers and innovators with cutting-edge tools to simplify workflows and accelerate impactful software creation. We’re on a mission to redefine how documents are created, shared, and experienced. Our software development kits enable companies to work smarter and faster, saving time and expenses along the way, while effectively replacing the need for paper processes.\nYour Role at Nutrient…\nThe team you will be joining is responsible for the Nutrient Web SDK. Take a look at its API docs to get an understanding of the scope involved: It is a toolbox for web engineers and application developers who need a painless way to render, edit and process documents. It either runs client-side using WebAssembly or connects to the Nutrient Document Engine.\nThis means that our SDK has to work for diverse use cases we constantly keep learning about from our customers. It needs to be convenient to use and easy to integrate; well architected, tested and documented; and loved by LLMs.\nYour day to day work ranges (depending on your personal preferences and the current priorities) from writing code and documentation to talking directly with customers in order to understand their use cases and devise solutions for them, which you will incorporate into the evolving architecture of the product.\nIf you think you have the aptitude to contribute to building this product we would like to hear from you. You'll have autonomy, learn a lot and will shape the future of this product.\nWhat You’ll Bring…\nStrong General Programming Skills: You're well versed in OOP & FP, data structures & algorithms and understand that even a client-side SDK forms part of a larger distributed system. You’re driven by a curiosity to understand how things work.\nPassion for Building in the B2D Space:  You don't write code for the sake of it, but to provide value to our customers by getting the user/developer experience right\nCollaborative and Self-Managing: You don't need hand-holding, and you're gaining energy from exchanging ideas, both async and sync.\nBias towards Shipping: You move fast and take ownership for solving problems from start to finish.\nWhat We'll Bring…\nWe are a globally distributed company, backed by Insight Partners. We embrace a low-meeting culture and prioritize asynchronous communication to provide flexibility and focus. Working hours overlap with most of the team across the US, Europe, and Asia.\nWe offer competitive salaries, comprehensive benefits, and an annual global retreat to celebrate achievements and foster connections. Past retreats have taken place in locations like Croatia, Spain, and Greece. \nNutrient believes in equal opportunity, we employ people from many different cultures and countries. We celebrate diversity and are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, skill sets, perspectives, as well as providing our employees with a work environment free of harassment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, marital status, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other non-merit factor. \nWe are a remote company. To ensure overlap with most of the team across the US, Europe and Asia, we’re looking for someone who will have a significant overlap with US and European working hours.  If working from the US, you must be located in Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, or Virginia for payroll processing.\nTo apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/nutrient-senior-typescript-sdk-engineer",

While your primary focus will be frontend development, we value engineers who are T-shaped, bringing deep expertise in one area while being comfortable contributing in others. Whether that means leading the way on web and mobile, diving into backend code, or lending an extra set of eyes in discovery, you’ll collaborate with your teammates to move work forward.\nMost importantly, you’ll actively contribute to the evolution of the culture and processes of a growing engineering team, especially our client engineering discipline (this is what we call the frontend web and mobile disciplines collectively). We want devs with opinions on patterns, code organization, and processes to help make sure our codebases scale healthily, and an interest in mentoring to help make sure our devs do too.\nWorking At CompanyCam\nOur engineering team is remote-first, spanning every time zone in the United States. We welcome people from all backgrounds and really don't care whether or not you have a CS degree or even a high school diploma. All that matters is that you're not an a**hole and you're good at what you do.\nAt CompanyCam we’re driven to produce work with meaningful outcomes. That means not just dumping features and “improvements” but being able to reflect and learn from our outputs. We’re actively working to center our work on continuous discovery habits (CDH) as outlined by Teresa Torres.\nOur teams are made up of a product manager, a product designer, a tech lead and an appropriate number of engineers for the scope of your team. We take a flexible approach, pulling from Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and even Shape Up. Rather than being overly prescriptive, we provide guardrails and just enough constraints to keep teams moving. Each team is expected to collaborate, iterate, and refine their best practices to produce high-quality work.\nWhat You’ll Do\nDesign, implement and deliver complex, cross-cutting features and systems in React and React Native, and occasionally in Ruby on Rails.\nLead efforts to address technical debt and system reliability, proactively identifying areas for refactoring or optimization.\nInfluence and evolve the architecture and system design, anticipating future needs and driving long-term improvements across services and applications.\nSet and uphold high standards for code quality, testing coverage, and documentation, mentoring others to do the same.\nDrive improvements to internal tooling to enhance developer experience and system resilience.\nFacilitate technical discussions and decision-making, helping the team navigate trade-offs and align on best solutions.\nAct as a point of escalation for complex technical challenges, supporting team members in unblocking progress.\nPartner closely with product managers, designers, and engineers, shaping feature direction by identifying technical opportunities, risks, and trade-offs early in discovery.\nWhat You’ll Bring\nMust-haves\nThese are our non-negotiables:\nShow up: give us your best and have the courage to do difficult but necessary stuff.\nGrow up: be humble, take responsibility, learn continuously, and have a growth mindset.\nDo good: treat your co-workers and customers the way you want to be treated.\n5+ years of experience working as a professional developer. (Not all years of experience are created equal, so this one isn't set in stone).\nAdvanced proficiency in React and Redux, or an equivalent JS framework and state management library, with experience guiding architectural decisions and best practices for frontend systems.\nExperience with React Native or native iOS or Android.\nExperience contributing across the full stack, including front-end, back-end, and data layers.\nDemonstrated experience in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to build, enhance, or optimize tools and features within products, driving innovation and improving user experience.\nAbility to handle complex tasks and ambiguous problems without guidance.\nUnderstanding of business trade-offs and ability to effectively communicate the risks and benefits of various technical approaches.\nStrong collaboration skills with the ability to lift up the team by providing mentorship and proactive feedback.\nYou live and work permanently in the U.S. (We’re not set up to hire outside the U.S.).\nNice-to-haves\nYou’ll encounter the following technologies with varying frequency — experience with them is a plus, but not required:\nGraphQL & REST\nApollo & TanStack Query\nRuby on Rails\nAndroid Studio & Xcode\nNative mobile development (Java, Objective-C, Kotlin, Swift)\nSnowflake\nExperience integrating with large language models (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini)\nBenefits and Compensation\nThis is a salaried position at CompanyCam. Our salary range is $175,000 - $200,000 per year and is based on experience.
