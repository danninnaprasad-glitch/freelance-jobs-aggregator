    "company": "WeWorkRemotely",
    "description": "Headquarters: Gent, Belgium\n    \nURL: https://silverfin.com/\n\n\n\nWe start with the cliff notes about the position. If this appeals to you, continue reading for a longer text about working at Silverfin and your role \n \nAt Silverfin, we're an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. Although we know we’re not perfect yet, we are working hard on it and always open for your feedback.\n \nAccording to our vision to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive organisation, our policy is to only make a final hiring decision if underrepresented groups are sufficiently represented in the list of candidates applying for the position. For this reason it’s possible interviews get slightly delayed until we’ve reached that goal.\n \nWe're committed to elevating talent by creating an environment where we can all thrive together. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily check every single box, please consider applying. We'd love to hear how you might contribute to our mission and our team.\nWhat can we offer you?\nActual, proper work-life balance\nFlexible working hours and work 100% remotely\nPersonal growth training and opportunities\nJoin a distributed remote-first engineering team with 40+ colleagues in 14 different countries on two continents\nA refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues\nA €1200 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills\nTwo engineering retreats per year, somewhere in Europe \nTen company-wide Wellbeing Days per year for all employees (once a month, except in July and August)\nCompensation\nFor this role, the compensation range is  €104.000 - €130.000 a year , which reflects the total compensation band for senior engineers at this level.\n \nPlease note:\nMost candidates start at the lower to mid part of the range, depending on experience and how their profile compares to our existing team. The higher end of the range is typically offered to individuals with a track record of strong impact and deep expertise in similar roles. We run annual compensation reviews, so there is clear opportunity for growth as you progress in the role.\nWhat will you work on?\nFigure out the best way to solve a customer or business problem in close collaboration with a product manager, a product designer and other engineers \nWork on user facing functionalities \nHelp with discovery and delivery of a solution \nGive the engineering perspective on potential ways of approaching a specific challenge \nHelp with maintenance and support of existing functionality\nWhat are we looking for?\nYou’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary.\nYou have experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough.\nYou're interested in getting to know our customers to find the best solution for a given challenge. \nYou can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally.\nYou’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognise bike-shedding and can avoid its pitfalls.\nYou know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.\nYou're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.\nYou’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.\nIf you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions , or read on for the more detailed explanation ..\n \nWhat’s a Silverfin?\nAt Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.\n \nThe good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.\n \nSince November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom.\n \nWhat’s the product team like?\nThe product team is a cross-functional team where engineers work together closely with product managers and product designers. The team's input is a user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy. From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem, ideating solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might actually lead to the desired outcome. After the discovery phase the same team is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution. The team will then track the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually solved. The setup of the team is largely based on the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan.\n \nWhat does working at Silverfin look like?\nNext to the four product teams, there are three more platformy teams, who own complex subsystems, like syncs or AI, and or support the product teams with knowledge, frameworks and services.\n \nOur ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”.\n \nWe run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice. \n \nNo code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.\n \nSoftware for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.\n \n*: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?\n \nWhat makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?\nWe’re a remote-first engineering team of 40 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.\n \nWorking with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself.\n \nYou also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.\n \nBeing remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in Quip, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!\n \nWe’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.\n \nWhat does your future look like?\nPersonal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.\n \nEveryone has a €1200 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day.\n \nRequirements\nYou have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming languages\nYou have experience Javascript framework(s)\nYour work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)\nYou can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally\nNice to haves\nThese would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you.\nExperience as a remote worker in a fully remote team\nExperience working with large datasets and the problems they bring\nExperience with Vue.js\nExperience in Fintech\nAccounting knowledge\n \nInterested?\nYou can apply today and we’ll start having interviews from 24/11/2025. There’s no benefit to applying early, so you can take your time answering the application questions.\n \nRead about what our interviewing process looks like \n \nWe may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.
