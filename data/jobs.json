While your primary focus will be frontend development, we value engineers who are T-shaped, bringing deep expertise in one area while being comfortable contributing in others. Whether that means leading the way on web and mobile, diving into backend code, or lending an extra set of eyes in discovery, you’ll collaborate with your teammates to move work forward.\nMost importantly, you’ll actively contribute to the evolution of the culture and processes of a growing engineering team, especially our client engineering discipline (this is what we call the frontend web and mobile disciplines collectively). We want devs with opinions on patterns, code organization, and processes to help make sure our codebases scale healthily, and an interest in mentoring to help make sure our devs do too.\nWorking At CompanyCam\nOur engineering team is remote-first, spanning every time zone in the United States.

All that matters is that you're not an a**hole and you're good at what you do.\nAt CompanyCam we’re driven to produce work with meaningful outcomes. That means not just dumping features and “improvements” but being able to reflect and learn from our outputs. We’re actively working to center our work on continuous discovery habits (CDH) as outlined by Teresa Torres.\nOur teams are made up of a product manager, a product designer, a tech lead and an appropriate number of engineers for the scope of your team. We take a flexible approach, pulling from Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and even Shape Up. Rather than being overly prescriptive, we provide guardrails and just enough constraints to keep teams moving. Each team is expected to collaborate, iterate, and refine their best practices to produce high-quality work.\nWhat You’ll Do\nDesign, implement and deliver complex, cross-cutting features and systems in React and React Native, and occasionally in Ruby on Rails.\nLead efforts to address technical debt and system reliability, proactively identifying areas for refactoring or optimization.\nInfluence and evolve the architecture and system design, anticipating future needs and driving long-term improvements across services and applications.\nSet and uphold high standards for code quality, testing coverage, and documentation, mentoring others to do the same.\nDrive improvements to internal tooling to enhance developer experience and system resilience.\nFacilitate technical discussions and decision-making, helping the team navigate trade-offs and align on best solutions.\nAct as a point of escalation for complex technical challenges, supporting team members in unblocking progress.\nPartner closely with product managers, designers, and engineers, shaping feature direction by identifying technical opportunities, risks, and trade-offs early in discovery.\nWhat You’ll Bring\nMust-haves\nThese are our non-negotiables:\nShow up: give us your best and have the courage to do difficult but necessary stuff.\nGrow up: be humble, take responsibility, learn continuously, and have a growth mindset.\nDo good: treat your co-workers and customers the way you want to be treated.\n5+ years of experience working as a professional developer. (Not all years of experience are created equal, so this one isn't set in stone).\nAdvanced proficiency in React and Redux, or an equivalent JS framework and state management library, with experience guiding architectural decisions and best practices for frontend systems.\nExperience with React Native or native iOS or Android.\nExperience contributing across the full stack, including front-end, back-end, and data layers.\nDemonstrated experience in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to build, enhance, or optimize tools and features within products, driving innovation and improving user experience.\nAbility to handle complex tasks and ambiguous problems without guidance.\nUnderstanding of business trade-offs and ability to effectively communicate the risks and benefits of various technical approaches.\nStrong collaboration skills with the ability to lift up the team by providing mentorship and proactive feedback.\nYou live and work permanently in the U.S. (We’re not set up to hire outside the U.S.).\nNice-to-haves\nYou’ll encounter the following technologies with varying frequency — experience with them is a plus, but not required:\nGraphQL & REST\nApollo & TanStack Query\nRuby on Rails\nAndroid Studio & Xcode\nNative mobile development (Java, Objective-C, Kotlin, Swift)\nSnowflake\nExperience integrating with large language models (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini)\nBenefits and Compensation\nThis is a salaried position at CompanyCam. Our salary range is $175,000 - $200,000 per year and is based on experience.

Learn more at olas.network.\nOur Products\nWith Olas’ Pearl, the first “AI Agent App Store”, any consumer with a laptop can use AI agents they truly own. With Olas’ Mech Marketplace, the “AI Agent Bazaar”, businesses can put their AI agent up for hire to earn crypto and tap into other AI agents’ services. Today, Olas’ AI Agents serve diverse use cases - from prediction markets and asset management to influencer agents - autonomously creating valuable outcomes. The OLAS utility token provides access to the platform’s benefits and coordinates agent interactions in entire AI Agent economies.\nOur Team\nValory is the team you’d be joining, working on Olas (the open-source technology governed by the Olas DAO). Valory is VC-backed team of engineers, researchers and commercial executors that raised its own successful Seed round and co-created Olas, executing a successful public token launch and subsequent $13.8m raise for the Olas DAO. We believe Artificial General Intelligence will likely be agentic and must be co-owned.
