Do you like working as part of a small team with deep technical expertise and having lots of impact on hardware development? And finally, do you enjoy a good keyboard?\nIf so, I'd love to talk to you. I'm Erez, and I run ZSA. We make nice keyboards (the ErgoDox EZ, Moonlander, and Voyager) and we've got lots of ideas. We're also passionate about open-source and have been contributing to the QMK open-source keyboard project for many years, and have open-sourced other work as well.\nWe're small, bootstrapped, and fully remote. We're a company of grownups — no invasive monitoring, and meetings only as needed, no exhausting daily video standups. \nWe do use a kanban system and create detailed work items, so requirements are not going to shift under your feet. We also listen to what you think. Our process is collaborative, and the right person for this role will have a big impact on our small business, and possibly on the keyboard community far outside of ZSA as well.\nIf this sounds interesting, the link goes to a Typeform I'd love for you to fill out. We don't look at resumes, but the Typeform isn't boring, I promise.
