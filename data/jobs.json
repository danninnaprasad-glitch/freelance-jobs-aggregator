Our software development kits enable companies to work smarter and faster, saving time and expenses along the way, while effectively replacing the need for paper processes.\nYour Role at Nutrient…\nThe team you will be joining is responsible for the Nutrient Web SDK. Take a look at its API docs to get an understanding of the scope involved: It is a toolbox for web engineers and application developers who need a painless way to render, edit and process documents. It either runs client-side using WebAssembly or connects to the Nutrient Document Engine.\nThis means that our SDK has to work for diverse use cases we constantly keep learning about from our customers. It needs to be convenient to use and easy to integrate; well architected, tested and documented; and loved by LLMs.\nYour day to day work ranges (depending on your personal preferences and the current priorities) from writing code and documentation to talking directly with customers in order to understand their use cases and devise solutions for them, which you will incorporate into the evolving architecture of the product.\nIf you think you have the aptitude to contribute to building this product we would like to hear from you. You'll have autonomy, learn a lot and will shape the future of this product.\nWhat You’ll Bring…\nStrong General Programming Skills: You're well versed in OOP & FP, data structures & algorithms and understand that even a client-side SDK forms part of a larger distributed system. You’re driven by a curiosity to understand how things work.\nPassion for Building in the B2D Space:  You don't write code for the sake of it, but to provide value to our customers by getting the user/developer experience right\nCollaborative and Self-Managing: You don't need hand-holding, and you're gaining energy from exchanging ideas, both async and sync.\nBias towards Shipping: You move fast and take ownership for solving problems from start to finish.\nWhat We'll Bring…\nWe are a globally distributed company, backed by Insight Partners. We embrace a low-meeting culture and prioritize asynchronous communication to provide flexibility and focus. Working hours overlap with most of the team across the US, Europe, and Asia.\nWe offer competitive salaries, comprehensive benefits, and an annual global retreat to celebrate achievements and foster connections. Past retreats have taken place in locations like Croatia, Spain, and Greece. \nNutrient believes in equal opportunity, we employ people from many different cultures and countries. We celebrate diversity and are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, skill sets, perspectives, as well as providing our employees with a work environment free of harassment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, marital status, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other non-merit factor. \nWe are a remote company. To ensure overlap with most of the team across the US, Europe and Asia, we’re looking for someone who will have a significant overlap with US and European working hours.  If working from the US, you must be located in Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, or Virginia for payroll processing.\nTo apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/nutrient-senior-typescript-sdk-engineer",
