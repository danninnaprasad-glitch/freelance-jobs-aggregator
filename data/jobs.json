    "description": "Headquarters: United States\n    \nURL: https://talentgenius.io\n\n\nAre you a pragmatic full‑stack engineer who ships quickly, cares about UX, and wants to turn Agentic + Generative‑AI capabilities into products people actually use?  Read on.\n\n## The Role (What this job is)\n\nWork directly with the CTO and a small, focused team to build AgentPowered; the marketplace where agent builders and companies create, list, discover, and transact with AI agents, and agentic teams.  You’ll own end‑to‑end features across the stack, integrate LLM/agent tooling, and make the platform fast, reliable, and secure.\n\n## What You’ll Build (Scope of work)\n\n- User‑facing surfaces: profiles, listings, search/ranking, proposals → contracts, billing, and payouts.\n- Backend/API: clean REST/JSON (and webhooks), authN/Z, idempotent actions, pagination, rate‑limits.\n- Data + workflows: Postgres schemas, queues/schedulers, sync pipelines, and telemetry events.\n- AI integrations: embeddings, retrieval, evaluators, and agent/tool runtimes wired into product flows.\n- Guardrails: cost controls, tracing, feature flags, and rollback paths baked in.\n \n## How You Work — The Agentic Mindset\n\n- Goal → Plan → Act → Observe → Reflect loops; ship small, measurable deltas weekly.\n- Tool‑use: pick/chain tools (LLMs, evaluators, retrievers, external APIs) with typed I/O and clear contracts.\n- Observability: trace every significant call; watch latency, error rates, token spend, and evaluator pass‑rates.\n- Safety & privacy: least‑privilege, encrypted secrets, PII minimization, auditability by default.\n- Bias to clarity: plain HTML‑first UX, simple APIs, boring infrastructure where it reduces risk.\n- Communicate clearly: must speak and write native-level English.\n\n## Experience That Maps\n\n- 5+ years shipping user‑facing web products end‑to‑end (front‑end + back‑end + Postgres/SQL).\n- Strong TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML, CSS; comfort with server‑rendered web.\n- API craftsmanship (authN/Z, idempotency, pagination) and schema design.\n- Bonus: embeddings/RAG/evals; payments/marketplaces; multi‑tenant SaaS; Astro/HTMX.\n\n## Your Agentic Toolbelt\n\n### VS Code extensions\n\n- GitHub Copilot, Cline, Continue, etc.\n- GitGraph, ESLint, Prettier, etc.\n- Mermaid Markdown\n\n### CLI & local tools\n\n- gh (GitHub CLI), just or task (repeatable commands)\n- Claude Code, Google Gemini, OpenAI Codex, Augment, Aider, etc.\n- Ollama (local models), Promptfoo (prompt/eval regression)\n- psql/pgcli, Docker/Orbstack, local OpenTelemetry Collector\n\n### Likely MCP servers you’ll wire up\n\n- Filesystem, Git/GitHub, http/fetch\n- Postgres (incl. vector search), Redis/cache\n- Microsoft/playwright-mcp (validation/capture)\n- Slack, Linear, Notion\n- Custom AgentPowered services as tools (listings, contracts, payouts)\n\n# Who We Are\n\nTalentGenius is the home for finding People + AI Agent solutions.  We are a fully remote Americas-based team building the future of how agentics build teams and find work and how companies find agentic solutions.  We are deeply dedicated to creating new business models and new technical solutions that will help usher in the Agentic Era.\n \nTo apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/talentgenius-full-stack-software-engineer-applied-ai-remote",
