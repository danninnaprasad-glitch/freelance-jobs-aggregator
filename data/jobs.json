You'll be managing scopes of work, defining specifications, coordinating with partners, and reviewing implementations to ensure they meet expectations.\n \nThe Job\nYour main task would be to guide projects through their lifecycle. You'll take initiatives like “we need to integrate with an external partner” and own them end-to-end: reaching out to contacts, scoping requirements, breaking down the work for developers, and reviewing the final results against the plan.\nThis role is hands-on. You should be comfortable installing our WIP apps locally, running Docker, testing APIs, and troubleshooting why something is or isn't working. While you won't be coding full time, you'll need enough technical grounding to validate solutions, explore edge cases, and communicate effectively with the development team.\nWe have dozens of 3rd-party integrations and ongoing refinements to our core systems. You'll be helping define the specs for these, ensure clarity for developers, and follow up through delivery. Some work may involve reviewing infrastructure or tooling setups, so being willing to dive into technical details is important.\nYou'll be working with an all-remote team that's used to getting work done through text-based channels (backlogs, wikis, and Slack conversations). Great text-based asynchronous communication is key to this position. You have to be a good writer, being able to explain your ideas clearly to the rest of the team.\n \nSkills\nWe'll assess candidates across multiple categories. Strength in one area can offset less experience in another.\nExperience managing technical projects from planning to delivery\nAbility to create and review detailed specifications for developers\nHands-on technical skills: installing apps locally, using Docker, testing integrations\nExperience with 3rd-party API integrations\nStrong written communication and organizational skills\nFamiliarity with production environments and troubleshooting workflows\nExperience in healthcare, or fintech would be a plus\nPrevious background as a developer, systems analyst, or similar technical role would be a plus\n \nTechnologies We Use\nFor reference, some keywords for tools and technologies in our stack:\nAWS (many products)\nPHP\nLaravel\nGraphQL APIs (writing and consuming)\nStripe, Twilio, Google APIs, Dropbox APIs, and many other 3rd-party integrations\nOpenSearch\nOpenAI APIs and other AI-related tooling\n \nPosition\nThis is a full-time remote position. We're used to working as a dispersed team so you must be cool with collaborating online and a lot over text. We're flexible on schedules, but at least 4 hours of overlap with a core of your team is mandatory.\nTo apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/entermotion-technical-project-manager",
