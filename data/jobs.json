Instead, we embrace Shape Up from 37 Signals, a product development framework designed to avoid endless planning, micromanagement, and scope creep.\nFixed Time, Variable Scope – We work in monthly cycles with clear priorities. We decide how much time we want to spend on a problem and shape solutions to fit within that timeframe.\nShaping – Before a project gets scheduled, we shape it—defining the problem, solution, risks, and constraints upfront. Only well-formed, concrete ideas make it to development.\nTeam of 1 – No micromanaging. No back-and-forth over tiny details. You decide how to execute within the defined problem space.\nPair Project Management – You're not alone, but working together with one of our team for each step of the project\nWorking Meetings - We thrive with async comms for updates. We use virtual calls to untangle issues and write code together.\nTo apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/inovo-studios-full-stack-javascript-developer-shape-up-small-team-1",
