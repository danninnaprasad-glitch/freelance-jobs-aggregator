This role is for a full redesign of our website — not client work, not multiple sites.\nYou’ll turn our Figma design into a custom WordPress site — no page builders, just a thoughtful, performant, hand-coded theme. We'll launch the new design component-by-component to the live site, so you’ll work closely with our team to build and ship each part with care.\nWe use GitHub for version control. You should be confident in CSS, Tailwind CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and HTML. If you have an eye for detail and care about helping people through your work, we’d love to meet you.\n(Note: We don't need/use JS frameworks like React, Vue.js, etc.)\nWhat does the work look like?\nWe’re looking for a front-end developer to work in between our design & tech teams. Our current project is a major redesign, which still has a lot of logic to code. After that, you could be working on any number of projects, from interactive tools built from scratch (ex: an Operating Agreement generator) to internal tools for the content team. \nAs a first step, you’ll get a full walkthrough of what’s been built so far. You might review or audit the code, and you’ll be part of the brainstorming and problem-solving process. You’ll also help us figure out exactly what work still needs to be done.\nKey Responsibilities:\nTurn detailed Figma designs into a responsive, accessible, and fully functional WordPress site\nWrite clean, efficient, and maintainable code using CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML.\nMake sure everything works across browsers and runs fast\nWork closely with our designer, back-end developer, founder, and SEO strategist to get every detail right — we care deeply about doing great work\nHelp improve how we build things by refining our process and sharing ideas\n\nRequired Skills & Qualifications:\n10+ years of front-end WordPress experience\nExpert at turning Figma designs into custom WordPress themes\nStrong in CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML.\nVast experience using Tailwind CSS in real-world projects\nStrong proficiency in CSS and modern layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid, etc.)\nDeep understanding of responsive and adaptive design\n3+ years using Git for version control\nClear and thoughtful communication in English — written and spoken\nWilling to have honest, open, even though conversations when needed — we care about trust and doing great work together\nA strong culture fit — we're a kind, friendly team that cares about details, good communication, and helping each other do our best work\n\nPersonal Traits:\nYou have a growth mindset and love learning new things to keep improving your craft\nYou bring a positive attitude, take initiative, and enjoy solving tough problems\nYou’re comfortable working as part of a team and independently — we work on the Eastern Time zone.\nNote: We do lots of video calls and screensharing for brainstorming and troubleshooting.\nWhy Join Us?\nCollaborate on high-impact projects with a passionate, supportive team.\nEmbrace a culture that values positivity, growth, and professional excellence.\nEnjoy flexibility, autonomy, and opportunities to grow your skillset.\nTo apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/llcu-university-senior-front-end-wordpress-developer-tailwind-specialist",
